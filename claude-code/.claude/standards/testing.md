# Testing Standards and Practices

## Unit Testing

**Tools**: Vitest and React Testing Library

Vite and React Testing Library are frequently used together for **Unit Testing**. This guide will show you how to setup Vitest with Next.js and write your first tests.

> **Good to know:** Since `async` Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, Vitest currently does not support them. While you can still run **unit tests** for synchronous Server and Client Components, we recommend using **E2E tests** for `async` components.

### Setup

To manually set up Vitest, install `vitest` and the following packages as dev dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom vite-tsconfig-paths
```

Create a `vitest.config.mts|js` file in the root of your project, and add the following options:

```ts filename="vitest.config.mts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tsconfigPaths(), react()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
  },
})
```

For more information on configuring Vitest, please refer to the [Vitest Configuration](https://vitest.dev/config/#configuration) docs.

Then, add a `test` script to your `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
```

When you run `pnpm run test`, Vitest will **watch** for changes in your project by default.

### Creating your first Vitest Unit Test

Check that everything is working by creating a test to check if the `<Page />` component successfully renders a heading:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="__tests__/page.test.tsx"
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import Page from '../app/page'

test('Page', () => {
  render(<Page />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Home' })).toBeDefined()
})
```

> **Good to know**: The example above uses the common `__tests__` convention, but test files can also be colocated inside the `app` router.

### Running your tests

Then, run the following command to run your tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## E2E Testing

**Tools**: Playwright

Playwright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. You can use it to write **End-to-End (E2E)** testing. This guide will show you how to set up Playwright with Next.js and write your first tests.

### Setup

To install Playwright, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm create playwright
```

This will take you through a series of prompts to setup and configure Playwright for your project, including adding a `playwright.config.ts` file. Please refer to the [Playwright installation guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation) for the step-by-step guide.

### Creating your first Playwright E2E test

Create two new Next.js pages:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/about/page.tsx"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Then, add a test to verify that your navigation is working correctly:

```ts filename="tests/example.spec.ts"
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('should navigate to the about page', async ({ page }) => {
  // Start from the index page (the baseURL is set via the webServer in the playwright.config.ts)
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')
  // Find an element with the text 'About' and click on it
  await page.click('text=About')
  // The new URL should be "/about" (baseURL is used there)
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('http://localhost:3000/about')
  // The new page should contain an h1 with "About"
  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('About')
})
```

> **Good to know**: You can use `page.goto("/")` instead of `page.goto("http://localhost:3000/")`, if you add [`"baseURL": "http://localhost:3000"`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url) to the `playwright.config.ts` [configuration file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).

### Running your Playwright tests

Playwright will simulate a user navigating your application using three browsers: Chromium, Firefox and Webkit, this requires your Next.js server to be running. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.

Run `npm run build` and `npm run start`, then run `npx playwright test` in another terminal window to run the Playwright tests.

> **Good to know**: Alternatively, you can use the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver/) feature to let Playwright start the development server and wait until it's fully available.

### Running Playwright on Continuous Integration (CI)

Playwright will by default run your tests in the [headless mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#running-headed). To install all the Playwright dependencies, run `npx playwright install-deps`.
