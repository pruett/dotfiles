# Plannotator Last

## Message annotations

!`plannotator annotate-last $ARGUMENTS`

## Your task

The output above will be one of:

1. The exact text `The user approved.`, OR a JSON object with `"decision": "approved"`. The user approved your last message. If that object also carries a `"feedback"` field, the user approved *with notes*: read them and carry them into subsequent work — they are non-blocking guidance, not a request to revise the message. Otherwise acknowledge with a single sentence ("Approved.") and stop. Either way, do not begin any work.
2. Empty, OR a JSON object with `"decision": "dismissed"`. The user closed the session without requesting changes. Acknowledge with a single sentence ("Annotation session closed.") and stop. Do not begin any work.
3. Plaintext annotation feedback, OR a JSON object with `"decision": "annotated"` and a `"feedback"` field. Address the feedback. The user has reviewed your last message and provided specific annotations and comments.
